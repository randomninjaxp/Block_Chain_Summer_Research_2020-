# Plan for the Summer Research on Blockchain
The project consists of the preface stage where the general block chain structure is completed. Testing, debugging, documentation. Followed by the integration of an AI. Which brings more testing, debugging and documentation. Then planning for a GUI and different implementations like a banking system, inventory management, or analytics.  
## Goal
  Create a program that has the fundamental structures of block chain and AI with a good GUI for user acess.
## Milestones
* General Block Chain Structure
  * Finish structure by the end of May with documentation and no major bugs
* General Block Chain Structure + AI Structure
  * Have 25% of the AI Structure done by end of May
  * Finish the rest of the AI Structure with documentation and no major bugs by the end of June
* GUI for implentations
  * Construct a GUI and implement various features like a banking system, inventory management, or analytics with documentation and no      major bugs by the end of July.
  * Finishing touches in August and presentation of finished product
## Deliverables
*  General Block Chain Structure
*  General Block Chain Structure + AI Structure
*  GUI for implentations
